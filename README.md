This project focuses on modern UI/UX practices using CustomTkinter. It was developed through a collaborative workflow where the Concept and Logic were designed by Renji, while the implementation, code generation, and refactoring were assisted by AI tools (Antigravity/Gemini). This approach demonstrates how AI can be utilized to efficiently bring creative ideas to life.
